## Introduction
Last year marks the creation of my first game using Unity. It is a timed platformer where you have to go through multiple rooms, each with their own challenge. This was a solo project except for a room that was given to us to integrate into the game. The textures, meshes, or any other asset, have NOT been made by me. This is part of a school project however everything that bas been added to the game has been chosen by me except that it had to be a platformer.

### Level 9
Each pillar moves in a square fashion. From point A to B to C to D, each point corresponding to the corner of the square. With that in mind, you can deduce where the pillar will move, and pass to the final level. <br>
